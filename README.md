# ‚úåÔ∏è Say Hello to AlbertCoin

üß¨ **So, what is AlbertCoin?**

**AlbertCoin (LBRT)** is an automated market maker (AMM) built on the Solana blockchain which leverages the central order book of the Serum decentralized exchange (DEX) to enable lightning-fast trades, shared liquidity and new features for earning yield.

**üëΩ Why is AlbertCoin different?**&#x20;

Other AMM DEXs and DeFi protocols are only able to access liquidity within their own pools and have no access to a central order book. Additionally, with the majority of platforms running on Ethereum, transactions are slow and gas fees are high.

Raydium offers a few key advantages:

1. **Faster and cheaper**: Raydium leverages the efficiency of the Solana blockchain to achieve transactions magnitudes faster than Ethereum and gas fees which are a fraction of the cost.
2. **A central order book for ecosystem-wide liquidity**: Raydium provides on-chain liquidity to the central limit order book of the Serum DEX, meaning that Raydium allows access to the order flow and liquidity of the entire Serum ecosystem.&#x20;
3. **Trading interface:** For traders who want to be able to view TradingView charts, set limit orders and have more control over their trading.

**üßê What can I do on Raydium?**

**Trade and swap**

Raydium's swap feature allows two tokens to be exchanged quickly through Serum, while the DEX UI also allows for more advanced trading features such as limit orders. These make for a better trading experience for users. &#x20;

**Earn RAY**&#x20;

There are a number of ways to earn RAY tokens while farming liquidity pools and staking. More features are on the way!
