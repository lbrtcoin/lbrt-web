# FAQ

## **Questions about** AlbertCoin

### **What is AlbertCoin and what makes it different?**

AlbertCoin is a new token and also a plaatform built on Solana where users can swap, trade and provide liquidity to earn yield on digital assets. However, unlike other AMM platforms, Raydium's AMM provides on-chain liquidity to Serum's central limit order book, meaning that Raydium’s users and liquidity pools have access to the order flow and liquidity of the entire Serum ecosystem, and vice versa.&#x20;

Raydium’s Best Price Swaps feature determines whether swapping within a liquidity pool or through the Serum order book will provide the best price for users.&#x20;

Not only can you trade and swap on Raydium, but there are a number of ways you can earn additional rewards while farming liquidity pools and staking. Raydium’s AcceleRaytor sets out to drive the growth of the Solana Ecosystem, serving as a launchpad for innovative projects to raise capital and drive initial liquidity.

### **Why build on Solana?**

Solana stands out in DeFi with lightning-fast speeds of up to 65,000 transactions per second, 400ms block times, and less than $0.01 average transaction fees. Raydium believes in the Solana vision and that it will power the future of De-Fi. Read more [here](https://medium.com/solana-labs/why-solana-8c927d58ba06).&#x20;
