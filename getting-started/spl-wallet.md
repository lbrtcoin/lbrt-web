# SPL Wallet

Before you get started with AlbertCoin, you'll need a Solana Program Library (SPL) wallet for storing your funds on the Solana blockchain and for interacting with the features on AlbertCoin. Remember that you'll need SOL in your wallet to complete any transactions on Solana. A few recommended wallets are listed below:

[Phantom](https://phantom.app) offers a wallet and browser extension with a streamlined, user friendly interface. Raydium highly suggests Phantom for new users and those that want a simple and straightforward wallet experience.
